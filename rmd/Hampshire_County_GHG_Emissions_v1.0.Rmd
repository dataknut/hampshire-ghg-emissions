# Introduction

This report uses two different datasets to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Hampshire County under three different definitions:

 - total annual _[territorial-based](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/netzeroandthedifferentofficialmeasuresoftheuksgreenhousegasemissions/2019-07-24#measuring-the-uks-progress-to-net-zero)_ **CO2** emissions for the period 2005 to 2019 using local authority district level data from [BEIS](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-local-authority-and-regional-carbon-dioxide-emissions-national-statistics-2005-to-2019);
 - total annual _territorial-based_ **CO2e** emissions (i.e. emissions for **all GHGs** - [carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/overview/ghg-overview)) with the addition of international shipping and aviation using the Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE) [Impact Tool](https://impact-tool.org.uk/download) data at the local authority level. The CSE's [methodology report](https://impact-tool.org.uk/static/doc/Impact-methodology-paper-v1.6.pdf) gives details of how each category was estimated and the years from which the data is drawn;
  - total annual _[consumption-based](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/netzeroandthedifferentofficialmeasuresoftheuksgreenhousegasemissions/2019-07-24#the-uks-carbon-footprint)_ **CO2e** emissions from the Centre for Sustainable Energy's [Impact Tool](https://impact-tool.org.uk/download) data at the local authority level.
  
The analysis is carried out for the 'Wider Hampshire' area, i.e. _all 14_ local authority districts in the Hampshire County **including the unitary authorities of Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight**. Note that this differs from the baseline estimated for the Hampshire County Council [Climate Change Strategy](https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/environment/climatechange/whatarewedoing/climatechangestrategy) by The Carbon Trust which _excluded_ Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight. A brief comparison of the '14 district' estimates with the '11 district' Carbon Trust estimates is  included in this report.

# Carbon Trust estimates

As background to the Hampshire County Council [Climate Change Strategy](https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/environment/climatechange/whatarewedoing/climatechangestrategy), the Carbon Trust was asked to establish baseline emissions for the County **excluding Southampton, Portsmouth and Isle of Wight**. This baseline was converted to the proportion of emissions from different energy sources and reported as a trend plot on p14 of the Strategy as shown below. This highlighted that the main components of emissions were:

 * Industry & Commercial (~ 39%) 
 * Transport (~ 37%)
 * Residential energy use (~ 24%). 
 
Total kT CO2 baseline values were not included in this report.

```{r hccCT}
# imputed from values given in https://documents.hants.gov.uk/climate-change/ClimateChange-Strategic-Framework-of-Programmes.pdf

hampshire_CT_terr_Totals <- data.table::fread(here::here("data","inputs", "ClimateChange-Strategic-Framework-of-Programmes_imputed_Carbon_2019.csv"))
ct_transport <- hampshire_CT_terr_Totals[compareLab == "Transport", .(ktco2_CT)]
ct_res <- hampshire_CT_terr_Totals[compareLab == "Residential", .(ktco2_CT)]
ct_ind <- hampshire_CT_terr_Totals[compareLab == "Industry & Commercial", .(ktco2_CT)]

ct_total <- ct_transport + ct_res + ct_ind

ct_transport_pc <- round(100*(ct_transport/ct_total))
ct_res_pc <- round(100*(ct_res/ct_total))
ct_ind_pc <- round(100*(ct_ind/ct_total))
```

However the HCC Climate [Change Strategic Framework of Programmes](https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/environment/climatechange/whatarewedoing/strategicpriorities) which lays out the estimated total kT CO2 and % reduction for a range of proposed actions, enables the following baseline values to be imputed:

 * Industry & Commercial emissions = `r dkUtils::tidyNum(ct_ind,0)` kT CO2
 * Transport emissions = `r dkUtils::tidyNum(ct_transport,0)` kT CO2
 * Residential emissions = `r dkUtils::tidyNum(ct_res,0)` kT CO2

Using the proportion values in the figure above, this gives a total of `r dkUtils::tidyNum(ct_total,0)` kT CO2 for the 11 districts.

# BEIS: Territorial CO2 emissions

These official [BEIS National Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-local-authority-and-regional-carbon-dioxide-emissions-national-statistics-2005-to-2019) use the end-user [territorial emissions method](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/996059/local-authority-co2-emissions-technical-report-2019.pdf) (_"meaning CO2 emissions that occur within the UK’s borders"_) and include _only_ CO2 emissions. As a result international aviation and shipping are _excluded_ from these estimates.

Note also that:

"_The end user basis for reporting emissions has been chosen for this dataset because it accounts for the emissions from energy use at the local level and does not penalise local areas for emissions from the production of energy which is then ‘exported’ to and used in other areas._" ([technical report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/996059/local-authority-co2-emissions-technical-report-2019.pdf), p8)

The following code loads the data and reports basic checks. A full data description can be found in Section \@ref(skimBeis).

BEIS have produced a useful [mapping tool](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/laco2app/) which can be used to compare the spatial distribution of different emissions sources at district level.

## Trends over time

Figure \@ref(fig:hampshireBEISCO2TotalTrends) shows trends over the period 2005 to 2019 for the CO2 emissions sources in the data. Overall there has been a clear reduction in emissions over the time period. The categories have been colour-coded so that related categories have similar colours in the palette.

```{r hampshireBEISCO2TotalTrends, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "BEIS CO2 emissions by category (Hampshire, 2019)"}
h_beis_sum_allYears_DT <- hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[, .(`Total kT CO2e` = sum(`Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`, na.rm = TRUE)), keyby = .(`Calendar Year`, subSectorLabelFact)]

ggplot2::ggplot(h_beis_sum_allYears_DT, aes(x = `Calendar Year`, 
                       y = `Total kT CO2e`,
                       fill = subSectorLabelFact)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = beis_emissions_colours) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", ) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=3)) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "LA CO2 Sub-sector")

# save this data out for future use
data.table::fwrite(h_beis_sum_allYears_DT, here::here("data","outputs", "all_hampshire_beis_categories_sum_kTCO2_allYears.csv"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:hampshireBEISCO2TotalTrendsLine) shows trends over time for these categories using a line plot to make it easier to see which categories have declined. This makes the recent trends in the reduction of emissions from the increasingly decarbonised electricity grid clearly visible. There has also been a slight decline in emissions due to domestic gas use but few other sources show substantial change.

```{r hampshireBEISCO2TotalTrendsLine, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "BEIS CO2 emissions by category (Hampshire)"}
p <- ggplot2::ggplot(h_beis_sum_allYears_DT, aes(x = `Calendar Year`, 
                       y = `Total kT CO2e`,
                       colour = subSectorLabelFact)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = beis_emissions_colours) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", ) +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(ncol=3)) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "LA CO2 Sub-sector")

p
```

Figure \@ref(fig:hampshireBEISCO2TotalTrendsLinePlotly) shows an interactive version of the same plot. Hovering over specific lines is useful for identifying the sources.

```{r hampshireBEISCO2TotalTrendsLinePlotly, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "BEIS CO2 emissions by category (Hampshire, 2019 ordered by emissions value)"}
library(plotly)
plotly::ggplotly(p)
```

## 2019 baseline

Table \@ref(tab:hampshireBEISCO2Total) shows the total CO2 emissions under this method for 2019 for all `r uniqueN(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT$la_name)` districts. 

```{r hampshireBEISCO2Total}
t <- hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[`Calendar Year` == 2019, .(`Total kT CO2e` = sum(`Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`, na.rm = TRUE))]
makeFlexTable(t, cap = "BEIS CO2 emissions (kT, 2019)")

sumBEIS_kt <- sum(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[`Calendar Year` == 2019]$`Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`)

sum_within_infl <- sum(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[`Calendar Year` == 2019]$`Emissions within the scope of influence of LAs (kt CO2)`)
```

Note that the total emissions deemed to be 'within the scope of influence of LAs' for 2019 is `r dkUtils::tidyNum(round(sum_within_infl),0)` kT CO2e. Categories deemed by BEIS to be outside local authorities' scope of influence in this data are:

 * all forms of land-use, land-use change and forestry
 * Transport: (Motorways)
 * Transport: Diesel Railways
 
Table \@ref(tab:hampshireBEISCO2TotalByCat) shows the total emissions for 2019 ordered by category. Figure \@ref(fig:hampshireBEISCO2TotalByCat) shows the data as a bar plot ordered by value. The largest emissions sources under this method are clearly visible (domestic gas, transport and domestic electricity).

```{r hampshireBEISCO2TotalByCat, fig.cap = "BEIS CO2 emissions by category (Hampshire, 2019 ordered by emissions value)"}
hampshire_beis_terr_Totals <- hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[`Calendar Year` == 2019, .(`Total kT CO2` = sum(`Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`, na.rm = TRUE)), keyby = .(subSectorLabelFact)]

absTotal <- sum(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[`Calendar Year` == 2019, abs(`Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`)])
                
hampshire_beis_terr_Totals[, `% of gross` := 100*(`Total kT CO2`/absTotal)]

makeFlexTable(hampshire_beis_terr_Totals[, .(Source = subSectorLabelFact, 
                                             `Total kT CO2`, `% of gross`)], cap = "BEIS CO2 emissions sorted by category (Hampshire, 2019)")

ggplot2::ggplot(hampshire_beis_terr_Totals, aes(x = reorder(subSectorLabelFact, -`Total kT CO2`), 
                       y = `Total kT CO2`,
                       fill = subSectorLabelFact)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = beis_emissions_colours) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "LA CO2 Sub-sector") +
  coord_flip()

# p <- ggplot2::ggplot(subsetDT, aes(x = `Calendar Year`, y = `Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`,
#                             fill = subSectorLabel,

#   geom_col(position = "stack") +
#   scale_colour_manual(values = beis_emissions_colours) +
#   scale_fill_manual(values = beis_emissions_colours) #
# p
```

Figure \@ref(fig:beisCumulative) shows a cumulative emissions plot for the BEIS 2019 data ordered by the emissions source's magnitude. The largest increments are therefore due to domestic gas use and various forms of transport. The plot uses vertical lines to show the sources which comprise 50%, 75% and 90% of the total emissions. The plot curls due to the source categories with negative emissions such that the final point represents the total 'net' emissions.

```{r beisCumulative, fig.cap="Plot of cumulative emissions (BEIS, 2019)"}
t <- hampshire_beis_terr_Totals[order(-`Total kT CO2`)]
t[, cumulative := cumsum(`Total kT CO2`)]

pc_50 <- 0.5*(sum(t$`Total kT CO2`))
pc_75 <- 0.75*(sum(t$`Total kT CO2`))
pc_90 <- 0.90*(sum(t$`Total kT CO2`))

p <- ggplot2::ggplot(t, aes(x = reorder(subSectorLabelFact, -`Total kT CO2`), 
                       y = cumulative,
                       colour = subSectorLabelFact)) +

beis_wetlands <- sum(h_beis2019[`LA CO2 Sub-sector` %like% "Wetland", `Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`])

beis_crop <- sum(h_beis2019[`LA CO2 Sub-sector` %like% "Crop", `Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`])

h_beis2019[, zeroC := ifelse(`LA CO2 Sub-sector` %like% "Gas",
                             0,
                             `Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`)]

h_beis2019[, zeroC := ifelse(`LA CO2 Sub-sector` %like% "Electricity",
                             0,
                             `Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`)]

h_beis2019[, zeroC := ifelse(`LA CO2 Sub-sector` %like% "roads",
                             0,
                             `Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`)]

beis_allSum <- sum(h_beis2019$`Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`)
zeroCsum <- sum(h_beis2019$zeroC)
```

Thus, if we focus on BEIS territorial CO2 only then 75% of emissions are due to:

 * Domestic gas: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_d_gas,0)` kT (`r round(100*(beis_d_gas/beis_allSum))` %));
 * Transport (Motorways, A roads and minor roads combined): `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_trans,0)` kT (Total: `r round(100*(beis_trans/beis_allSum))` %);
 * Domestic electricity: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_d_elec,0)` kT (`r round(100*(beis_d_elec/beis_allSum))` %))

Taken together the domestic (residential) emissions comprise `r round(100*((beis_d_gas + beis_d_elec)/beis_allSum))` % of the estimated total.

Negative CO2 emissions (sequestration) sources are:

 * Forest: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_forest,0)` kT
 * Grassland: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_grassland,0)` kT - note that this does not include methane emissions from grazing livestock nor N2O emissions from waste
 * Wetlands: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_wetlands,3)` kT - this is perhaps surprisingly small given the coastal nature of the County and the existence of a number of wetland habitats. it may be worth investigating [the underlying data](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1025) to confirm.

As Figure \@ref(fig:beisCumulative) showed, these levels of sequestration currently provided a negligible offset to the overall emissions. Note also that cropland was a net emitter at `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_crop,0)` kT. 

Figure \@ref(fig:hampshireBEISCO2TotalTrendsLine) showed that the only emissions sources showing substantial decreases over time have been electricity due to grid decarbonisation and (potentially) reductions in some industrial activity as well as the use of 'Other fuels' by industry. Although emissions from domestic gas use have also fallen over time they appear to have stabilised since 2014. Perhaps of most concern given their dominant contribution however is the relative stability of road transport emissions over the 2005 - 2019 period.

# CSE: Territorial-based all GHG emissions

The first of the CSE datasets estimates emissions under the territorial method **but including international aviation and shipping** and includes _all GHG_ emissions - [carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/overview/ghg-overview). As the non-CO2 gases have [different warming potentials](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/greenhouse-gas-data/frequently-asked-questions#eq-9) compared to CO2, emissions are reported in terms of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) rather than simply in terms of kT of gas emitted. The sum of kT CO2e for each source therefore represents the total contribution of all of the emissions to climate warming _allowing for their different warming potentials_.

The _inclusion_ of GHGs other than just CO2 means that identical categories in the CSE data will most likely have higher emissions estimates than the BEIS equivalent which only account for CO2. As an example, Transport emissions are based on the BEIS CO2 Transport emissions used in the previous section but were "_adjusted to account for [additional] non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions_". This is explained in detail in the [CSE methodology paper](https://impact-tool.org.uk/methodology):

_"Total CO2e emissions have been estimated for most sectors by comparison of CO2, N2O and CH4 emission factors for the most prevalent fuel type in the sector and factoring the CO2 emissions accordingly. The exceptions are other transport and LULUCF due to the diverse nature of emission sources; in these cases the CO2 figures have been used as-is."_ (p14)

For aviation and shipping:

_"National emissions data from these sources are reported by the NAEI, and have been apportioned on a population basis."_ (p15)

Finally, fluorinated gases (F-gases):

_"are apportioned commensurate with non-domestic electricity emissions, as systems utilising such gases are most prevalent in non-domestic buildings and electrically powered equipment)."_ (p15)

Figure \@ref(fig:cseTerrCumulative) shows a cumulative emissions plot for the CSE territorial data ordered by the emissions source's magnitude. The largest increments are therefore due to personal transport, domestic gas use and aviation. The plot shows the sources which comprise 50%, 75% and 90% of the total emissions. The plot curls due to the source categories with negative emissions such that the final point represents the total 'net' emissions.

```{r cseTerrCumulative, fig.cap="Plot of cumulative emissions (BEIS, 2019)"}

pc_diff_main <- 100*(cse_terr_diff_main/(sumCSETerr_kt - sumBEIS_kt))

pc_tot_diff <- 100*((sumCSETerr_kt-sumBEIS_kt)/sumBEIS_kt)

```

Thus, if we focus on CSE territorial _all GHG_ emissions, 75% of emissions are due to:

 * Road transport: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_Transport,0)` T CO2e (`r round(100*(cse_terr_Transport/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total)
 * Housing (domestic) gas: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_DomGas,0)` T CO2e (`r round(100*(cse_terr_DomGas/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total)
 * Aviation: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_aviation,0)` T CO2e - flights and freight (`r round(100*(cse_terr_aviation/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total)
 * Industrial & commercial electricity: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_ind_elec,0)` T CO2e (`r round(100*(cse_terr_ind_elec/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total)
 * Domestic electricity: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_d_elec,0)` T CO2e (`r round(100*(cse_terr_d_elec/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total)

These figures draw attention to the significant emissions due to aviation which are not included in the BEIS LA level data. They also draw attention to the level of _all GHG_  emissions from waste management. Indeed, `r dkUtils::tidyNum(pc_diff_main,0)` % of the `r dkUtils::tidyNum(pc_tot_diff,0)` % increase from the BEIS figure comprises emissions from:

  * _Aviation_ (`r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_aviation,0)` kT CO2e - i.e. flights & freight - `r round(100*(cse_terr_aviation/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total);
  * _Waste management_ (`r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_waste,0)` kT CO2e - `r round(100*(cse_terr_waste/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total);
  * _Shipping_ (`r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_shipping,0)` kT CO2e - `r round(100*(cse_terr_shipping/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total) and 
  * _F-Gases_ (`r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_fgas,0)` kT CO2e - `r round(100*(cse_terr_fgas/sumCSETerr_kt))` % of total)

Note that under the CSE approach, `Agriculture - Livestock and crop-related emissions ` amount to `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_terr_AgricLivestock,0)` T CO2e compared to the BEIS value for `Cropland` at `r dkUtils::tidyNum(beis_crop,0)` T CO2e which gives some indication of the additional emissions due to methane (noting that fuel used for agriculture is already in a separate category under the CSE approach - see [methodology, p15](https://impact-tool.org.uk/static/doc/Impact-methodology-paper-v1.6.pdf)).

Figure \@ref(fig:cseConsCumulative) shows a cumulative emissions plot for the CSE territorial data ordered by the emissions source's magnitude. The largest increments are therefore due to consumpiton of goods and services, food and diet (meat & fish) and mains gas use.

con_sum_pc <- 100*(cons_sum/sumCSECons_kt)
```

Thus, if we focus on CSE consumption-based emissions which include emissions 'outsourced' to other geographical areas (including overseas), the main emissions sources comprising `r dkUtils::tidyNum(con_sum_pc,0)` % of emissions are:
 
 * Purchased goods: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_cons_purch,0)` kT CO2e ( `r round(100*cse_cons_purch/sumCSECons_kt)` %)
 * Food and diet - meat & fish: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_cons_food_meat,0)` kT CO2e ( `r round(100*cse_cons_food_meat/sumCSECons_kt)` %)
 * Domestic gas: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_cons_DomGas,0)` kT CO2e as before ( `r round(100*cse_cons_DomGas/sumCSECons_kt)` %)
 * Food and diet - other: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_cons_food_other,0)` kT CO2e ( `r round(100*cse_cons_food_other/sumCSECons_kt)` %)
 * Private transport:`r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_cons_private_trans,0)` kT CO2e ( `r round(100*cse_cons_private_trans/sumCSECons_kt)` %)
 * Use of services: `r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_cons_use,0)` kT CO2e ( `r round(100*cse_cons_use/sumCSECons_kt)` %)

Emissions due to Flights (`r dkUtils::tidyNum(cse_cons_flights,0)` kT CO2e) are lower than the territorial based `Aviation` emissions values since emissions due to freight are included under 'Goods and services'.

This approach to emissions accounting shows the extent to which the consumption of goods and services, diet and food as well as transport and domestic gas use dominate Hampshire's 'consumption' emissions footprint.

# District level total emissions by method

Table \@ref(tab:districtTotals) and Figure \@ref(fig:districtTotals) show the total emissions under each method and source per district. As expected, in all cases CSE territorial emissions are higher than BEIS territorial emissions. Similarly, in most cases CSE consumption emissions are higher than territorial emissions except for Winchester, Test Valley, Basingstoke and Deane and New Forest. More detailed analysis of the underlying data would be required to understand the reasons for this.

# Discussion

```{r genDisc}

sumBEIS_hcc_kt <- sum(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[widerHampshire != "Wider Hampshire" & `Calendar Year` == 2019, `Territorial emissions (kt CO2)`])
```

Overall, the total GHG emissions for Hampshire under different methodologies were found to be:

 * Carbon Trust analysis (`r uniqueN(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[widerHampshire != "Wider Hampshire", la_name])` districts _excluding_ Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight): **`r dkUtils::tidyNum(ct_total,0)`** kT CO2
 * BEIS territorial CO2 only: 
   * **`r dkUtils::tidyNum(sumBEIS_hcc_kt,0)`** kT CO2 (`r uniqueN(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[widerHampshire != "Wider Hampshire", la_name])` districts _excluding_ Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight),
   * **`r dkUtils::tidyNum(sumBEIS_kt,0)`** kT CO2 (`r uniqueN(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[, la_name])` districts _including_ Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight)
 * CSE territorial emissions (all GHG, all `r uniqueN(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[, la_name])` districts): **`r dkUtils::tidyNum(sumCSETerr_kt,0)`** kT CO2e - `r dkUtils::tidyNum(pc_tot_diff,0)` % higher than the BEIS total
 * CSE consumption emissions (all GHG, all `r uniqueN(hampshire_beis_la_co2_DT[, la_name])` districts): **`r dkUtils::tidyNum(sumCSECons_kt,0)`** kT CO2e

Given that the Carbon Trust area _excludes_ Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight it is unclear why this total is similar to the '14 local authorities' BEIS data.

Which of these accounting methods we choose to focus on depends what we want to show and what we want to achieve. The same is true of the emissions subcategories. The BEIS data gives a partial view on territorial emissions as it excludes all non-CO2 emissions and also excludes aviation (flights & freight) and shipping. The CSE territorial emissions data includes these 'missing' emissions and so gives a much larger total. 

Table \@ref(tab:tableCompareTerr) compares the Carbon Trust, BEIS and CSE data to the extent that it is possible to do so from the data reported here.

makeFlexTable(t[,.(Source = compareLab,
                   CarbonTrust = ktco2_CT,
                   `Carbon Trust %` = ktco2_CT_pc,
                   BEIS = ktco2_beis,
                   `BEIS %` = ktco2_beis_pc,
                   `CSE Territorial` = ktco2_cse_terr,
                   `CSE Territorial %` = ktco2_cse_terr_pc,
                   `CSE Consumption` = ktco2_cse_cons,
                   `CSE Consumption %` = ktco2_cse_cons_pc)][order(CarbonTrust)], cap = "Comparing emissions baselines (values = kT CO2e or %)")
```
The table shows that the two main policy foci of the Hampshire County Council Climate Change Strategy - Transport and Residential - contribute at least 30% of emissions irrespective of the emissions accounting method used. 

The Carbon Trust estimate for Industrial & Commercial emissions for the '11 districts' appears to be considerably larger than the comparable BEIS '14 districts' value. This may be due to the exclusion in the BEIS data of single large power stations whose emissions are 'shared' across all grid electricity users, not just those in the relevant district. As a result the BEIS proportions for Transport and Residential emissions are higher (77% combined) compared to 58% in the Carbon Trust estimates for 11 districts.

Although the '14 districts' BEIS and CSE (territorial) main categories are broadly similar in terms of kT CO2(e), the percentage contribution of Transport and Residential emissions are considerably lower (56%) for the CSE data. This is due to the **inclusion of additional sources in the CSE data** such as Aviation (10%, shown) shipping and F-gases as well as _all GHG_ emissions (not just CO2) from transport, waste, agriculture, and others (see Table \@ref(tab:hampshireCSEterrTotalByCat) for details). Collectively these represent over 20% of county-wide emissions under the CSE territorial methodology.

Finally, the CSE consumption emissions data demonstrates the significant contribution that consumption of services as well as food and diet make to our 'extended' emissions footprint if we consider the emissions we have effectively outsourced to other geographical areas. This method transfers all of the industrial/commercial emissions and a significant proportion of the Transport/Aviation emissions to 'Good and services' and 'Food and diet' (i.e. supply chain transportation and distribution). As a result emissions from homes and private transport comprise only 33% of the total under this approach, flights a further 7% and the total for consumption of goods and services & food is ~58%


# Recommendations and future work

Based on the preceding discussion, this report makes the following recommendations to HCC:

 * adopt the annually updated [BEIS district level emissions data](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-local-authority-and-regional-carbon-dioxide-emissions-national-statistics) as the benchmark for: 
    * estimation of baseline emissions; 
    * transparent modelling of the potential impact of HCC programmes on CO2 emissions;
    * annual assessment of the district and county level emissions reduction progress;
    * assessment of the impact of district and county level emissions reduction policies where feasible;
 * work with BEIS to ensure the inclusion of _all_ territorial emissions (e.g. due to aviation, shipping, F-gases) and _all GHGs_ (i.e. [carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/overview/ghg-overview)) in the annual BEIS district level dataset. This would enable the **complete territorial emissions** of the area to be estimated and bring the district level data into line with the [national and sector level data reporting](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/resources/Sector_Summary_Factsheet_2020-v2.html) as well as with the CSE data reported here. This will enable:
    * robust baselining of emissions for **all territorial GHGs**, not just CO2;
    * transparent modelling of the potential impact of HCC programmes on _all territorial GHGs_;
    * effective monitoring of reductions in emissions of _all territorial GHGs_ over time.
 * include a section in the HCC's annual Climate Change Report which:
    * reviews the mapping between current HCC programmes and the major emissions sources under each emissions accounting method;
    * reviews the capability and capacity of County and District Authorities to influence the emissions sources for which no current programmes exist (c.f. the [Committee on Climate Change's recommendations](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/local-authorities-and-the-sixth-carbon-budget/) as part of the 6th Carbon Budget and the more recent [National Audit Office 2021 report](https://www.nao.org.uk/report/local-government-and-net-zero-in-england/) on local government capabilities with respect to net zero in England);

Future work could:

 * analyse the district level emissions to understand their distributions according to the different methodologies and hence inform district level prioritisation where this is not already in hand;
 * use [the underlying LULUCF data](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1025) to investigate the relatively low sequestration attributed to wetlands in the Hampshire area;
 * compare the results reported here with a similar analysis of the [CREDS Place-Based Carbon Calculator](https://www.carbon.place/data/) consumption-based footprint data.
